# Test tool for Renos (RFID)
This repository contains a tool that can be used to easily analyze the performance of a Renos-based RFID reader system.

It supports validating reads against a 'should' and 'should not' list, doing multiple test-runs and saving the parameters the test was done with. Results are exported to CSV files.
